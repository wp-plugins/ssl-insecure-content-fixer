Fix some common problems with insecure content on pages using SSL

== Description ==

Fix some common problems with insecure content on pages using SSL. Mostly, the fixes are CSS and JavaScript links that don't use SSL. How it does this is described in [this blog post](http://snippets.webaware.com.au/snippets/cleaning-up-wordpress-plugin-script-and-stylesheet-loads-over-ssl/).

It is very lightweight, so it doesn't impact on performance, but that also means it doesn't catch everything. Some fixes need a bigger hammer, like the [WordPress HTTPS](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-https/) plugin. If your problem is small, a small solution like this one might fit better.

**Current fixes:**

* scripts that are registered using wp_register_script or wp_enqueue_script
* stylesheets that are registered using wp_register_style or wp_enqueue_style
* images and other media loaded by calling wp_get_attachment_image(), wp_get_attachment_image_src(), etc.
* the stylesheet loaded by the [list-category-posts-with-pagination](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/list-category-posts-with-pagination) plugin
* images loaded by [image-widget](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/image-widget/) plugin

I'll be adding other fixes as I become aware of other problems that can be easily fixed. The better solution is to get errant plugins fixed by their authors, but until they do, let me know about other problems and I'll attempt to add fixes for them to this plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Upload this plugin to your /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

If your browser still reports insecure content, have a read of the [FAQ](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ssl-insecure-content-fixer/faq/). If that doesn't help, tell me the URL of the problem page in [the support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/ssl-insecure-content-fixer).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I get "insecure content" warnings from some of my content =

You are probably loading content with a URL that starts with "http:". Take that bit away, but leave the slashes, e.g. `//www.example.com/`; your browser should load the content, but will use SSL when your page uses it.

= My website is behind a load balancer or reverse proxy =

If your website is behind a load balancer or other reverse proxy, and WordPress doesn't know when SSL is being used, this plugin won't help. See my blog post, [WordPress is_ssl() doesnâ€™t work behind some load balancers](http://snippets.webaware.com.au/snippets/wordpress-is_ssl-doesnt-work-behind-some-load-balancers/), for some details. This plugin has a link to test whether is_ssl() is working, which you can find on the plugins page in your WordPress admin. You might be able to fix it by adding this to your wp-config.php file:

`
// Amazon AWS Elastic Load Balancer, CloudFlare, and some others
if (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO']) && $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO'] == 'https')
    $_SERVER['HTTPS']='on';
`

For websites hosted by Network Solutions, try downloading [this gist](https://gist.github.com/webaware/4688802) and saving it into your plugins folder, then enable the plugin "Force SSL URL Scheme".

= I still get "insecure content" warnings on my secure page =

Post about it to [the support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/ssl-insecure-content-fixer), and be sure to include a link to the page. Posts without working links will be ignored.

= You listed my plugin, but I've fixed it =

Great! Tell me which plugin is yours, and how to check for your new version, and I'll drop the "fix" from my next release.
